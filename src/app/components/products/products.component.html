        <p class="text-white text-center">Cement is hydraulic binder, i.e a finely ground inorganic material which, when mixed with water, forms a
            paste which set and hardens by means of hydration reactions and processes and which after hardening ,
            retains its strength and stability even under water.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-center mb-5">The United Cement Company is characterized by the production of high-quality cement products and the raw
            materials does not contain anything of all the impurities that have a direct impact on cement products
            including alkali, Chlorides, Sulphates, Potassium and Sodium in addition to the company quarry is located in
            part of Sarawat Mountains that are known of its high-quality raw materials. In addition, there is an
            automated monitors of production line which takes 100 samples a day to make sure that the products have high
            quality, the company assures it is high quality by sending products to local & international institutes to
            confirm it is high quality.</p>
